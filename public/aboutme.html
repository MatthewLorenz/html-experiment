  Thank you for viewing my HTML experiment. I am using this website  to explore web development
   - so far it has been a wonderful experience. As of 14 January 24 I graduated with a Bachelor of 
   Science in Computer Science. The knowledge I gained from the educational experience was invaluable. 
   When asked what I believe I got out of my education my typical answer is: "I learned the ability to struggle productively." 
   Having the ability to put my head down when work sucks and keep grinding is a skill that I seek to hone daily so 
   I don't forget what dicipline can sometimes feel like. Anecdotally, the topic I am looking most forward
   to is the advancement of AI and machine learning. The above image represents my likeness created by Wonder AI.
